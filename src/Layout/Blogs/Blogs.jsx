                        What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and where should we store them on the client-side?
                    </div>
                    <div className="collapse-content">
                        <p>A refresh token just helps you re-validate a user without them having to re-enter their login credentials multiple times. The access token is re-issued, provided the refresh token is a valid one requesting permission to access confidential resources. <br />
                            Modern web browsers support a number of ways for websites to store data on the user's computer — with the user's permission — then retrieve it when necessary. This lets you persist data for long-term storage, save sites or documents for offline use, retain user-specific settings for your site, and more. This article explains the very basics of how these work.

                        Compare SQL and NoSQL databases?

                        <p>SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores. SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.</p>

                        <p>What is Aggregation in MongoDB? Aggregation is a way of processing a large number of documents in a collection by means of passing them through different stages. The stages make up what is known as a pipeline. The stages in a pipeline can filter, sort, group, reshape and modify documents that pass through the pipeline.
